# task-one
<p>
This repo was created to perform a task. The task was to write a function that accepts an array of integers, nums, an integer, target and returns an array of numbers (just two) from the nums array such that the addition of both numbers add up to target.
</p>

For example, say nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
and target = 9
then the function should return [2, 7]

Finish.
